Youido
=============

Youido is a high level framework for developing Haskell web applications that satisfy a number of highly restrictive assumptions:

1. You are building enterprise style, not consumer facing, applications. 
2. You don't care about SEO ranking or what the URL looks like.
3. Your functionality is guarded by a user login
4. Productivity, flexibility, compositionality are more important than performance.
5. You want to write as little front-end code as possible. You are willing to sacrifice fine-grained user experience. All rendering will be done server side.
6. In fact, you want to write as little code as possible.
