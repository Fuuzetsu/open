Youido
=============

Youido is a high level framework for developing Haskell web applications that satisfy a number of highly restrictive assumptions:

1. You are building enterprise style, not consumer facing, applications.
2. You don't care about SEO ranking or what the URL looks like.
3. Your functionality is guarded by a user login
4. All rendering is done server-side
